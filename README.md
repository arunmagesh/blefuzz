# blefuzz
Not a fancy fuzzer. This is a simple BLE handle fuzzer. 


# Dependancies


pygatt --> https://github.com/peplin/pygatt
bluez --> sudo apt-get install bluez

Note: I have loads of package already installed in my system. in your case python will most probably return a error for missing library. just install it directly.

Thanks to https://github.com/siddharthbezalwar for helping me with python.

Any feedback and help is highly welcomed.
