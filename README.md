# blefuzz
Not a fancy fuzzer. This is a simple BLE handle fuzzer. 


# Dependancies
Good to have tools for BLE.
pybt --> https://github.com/mikeryan/PyBT
pybluez --> https://github.com/karulis/pybluez/
pygatt --> https://github.com/peplin/pygatt  --> Use 3.1.1 only and not the recent version
bluez --> sudo apt-get install bluez


Note: I have loads of package already installed in my system. in your case python will most probably return a error for missing library. just install it directly.

Thanks to https://github.com/siddharthbezalwar for helping me with python.

Any feedback and help is highly welcomed.
